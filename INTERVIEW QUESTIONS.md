You have 10 documents. Each topic has been tagged. When a new document arrives, how to tag it?
## **Document Classification: How to Tag a New Document Based on Existing Topics?**  

When you have **10 documents**, each tagged with a topic, and a **new document arrives**, you need to classify it into one of the existing topics. This is known as **Text Classification** or **Document Categorization**. 

We can use multiple approaches, including **Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Rule-Based Methods**. Let's break this down step by step.  

---

## **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**
- We have **10 labeled documents** (e.g., "Politics," "Technology," "Sports," etc.).
- A new document arrives.
- We need to assign a topic **automatically** based on similarity with existing documents.  

### **Example Dataset**
| Document | Content Snippet | Label (Topic) |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Doc 1 | "Government passes new law on taxation" | Politics |
| Doc 2 | "Apple releases new iPhone with AI features" | Technology |
| Doc 3 | "Real Madrid wins Champions League" | Sports |
| Doc 4 | "Python is a popular programming language" | Technology |
| Doc 5 | "NASA successfully lands rover on Mars" | Science |
| ... | ... | ... |
| New Document | "Tesla introduces autopilot update with improved AI" | ??? |

We need to classify the **new document** into an existing topic.

---

## **Step 2: Preprocessing the Documents**
Before we train a model, we need to convert raw text into a machine-readable format.

1. **Text Cleaning**
   - Convert to lowercase  
   - Remove stop words (e.g., "the", "is", "a")  
   - Remove punctuation and special characters  
   - Tokenization (split text into words)  
   - Lemmatization/Stemming (reduce words to their root form)

   **Example:**  
   `"Tesla introduces autopilot update with improved AI"`
   ‚Üí **Preprocessed Text:** `["tesla", "introduce", "autopilot", "update", "improve", "ai"]`

2. **Feature Extraction (Vectorization)**
   - Convert text into numerical representation.
   - Common methods:
     - **Bag of Words (BoW)** (word frequency)
     - **TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)**
     - **Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT)**
     - **Sentence Embeddings (SBERT, Universal Sentence Encoder)**  

   **Example: TF-IDF Representation**  
   ```
   Document 1: [0.1, 0.3, 0.0, 0.5, ...]  
   Document 2: [0.2, 0.1, 0.6, 0.0, ...]  
   New Doc   : [0.0, 0.1, 0.4, 0.2, ...]  
   ```

---

## **Step 3: Choosing a Classification Approach**
There are **three** main approaches:

### **1. Similarity-Based Approach (KNN, Cosine Similarity)**
üìå **Best for small datasets (like our 10 documents).**  
- Calculate similarity between the new document and existing ones.  
- Use **Cosine Similarity** or **Euclidean Distance** to find the most similar document.  
- Assign the label of the most similar document.

üìå **Example: Cosine Similarity Calculation**  
\[
\text{Cosine Similarity} = \frac{A \cdot B}{||A|| \times ||B||}
\]
Where **A** and **B** are TF-IDF vectors of the documents.

üìå **Implementation:**
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Sample documents
documents = [
    "Government passes new law on taxation",
    "Apple releases new iPhone with AI features",
    "Real Madrid wins Champions League",
    "Python is a popular programming language",
    "NASA successfully lands rover on Mars"
]

labels = ["Politics", "Technology", "Sports", "Technology", "Science"]

# New document to classify
new_doc = ["Tesla introduces autopilot update with improved AI"]

# Convert to TF-IDF vectors
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents + new_doc)

# Compute similarity
similarities = cosine_similarity(X[-1], X[:-1])  # Compare new doc with existing ones
best_match_idx = similarities.argmax()
predicted_label = labels[best_match_idx]

print(f"Predicted Topic: {predicted_label}")  # Output: Technology
```

---

### **2. Machine Learning-Based Approach (Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, Random Forest)**
- Train an ML classifier on the existing labeled documents.
- Use feature vectors (TF-IDF, BoW) as input.
- Train on historical data and predict on new documents.

üìå **Steps:**  
1. **Train the model using labeled documents**  
2. **Convert new document to vector representation**  
3. **Predict label using the trained model**  

üìå **Implementation using Na√Øve Bayes:**
```python
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Convert documents to vectors
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)
y = labels  # Labels

# Train the model
model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict label for new document
new_X = vectorizer.transform(new_doc)
predicted_label = model.predict(new_X)[0]

print(f"Predicted Topic: {predicted_label}")  # Output: Technology
```

üîπ **Advantages:**  
‚úÖ Works well for text classification  
‚úÖ Fast and scalable  
‚úÖ Handles noisy data well  

üîπ **Disadvantages:**  
‚ùå Requires enough training data  
‚ùå May not work well for unseen words  

---

### **3. Deep Learning Approach (LSTMs, Transformers like BERT)**
- Convert text into **word embeddings** (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT).  
- Train a deep learning model (LSTM, CNN, Transformer).  
- Predict topic based on learned representations.  

üìå **Example using BERT for classification:**
```python
from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline("zero-shot-classification")

new_text = "Tesla introduces autopilot update with improved AI"
labels = ["Politics", "Technology", "Sports", "Science"]

result = classifier(new_text, candidate_labels=labels)
print(result['labels'][0])  # Output: Technology
```
üîπ **Advantages:**  
‚úÖ **Highly accurate**  
‚úÖ Can understand **context & semantics**  
‚úÖ Works well on large datasets  

üîπ **Disadvantages:**  
‚ùå Requires **large dataset & high computational power**  
‚ùå Training can be slow  

---

## **Step 4: Evaluating Model Performance**
- Use **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score** to measure performance.  
- Use a **confusion matrix** to analyze misclassifications.  

üìå **Evaluation Example:**
```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

---

## **Step 5: Deploying the Model**
- Convert the trained model into an API (Flask/FastAPI).  
- Integrate it into a **real-world application** (e.g., search engine, chatbot).  
- Deploy on **cloud platforms** (AWS, GCP, Azure).  

---

## **Final Summary: Best Approach Based on Your Use Case**
| Approach | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|----------|---------|------|------|
| Cosine Similarity (KNN) | Small datasets | Simple, No training needed | Slow for large data |
| Na√Øve Bayes / SVM | Medium-sized datasets | Fast, Good accuracy | Needs labeled data |
| Deep Learning (BERT, LSTM) | Large datasets | Best accuracy, Understands semantics | Requires high compute |

---

## **üöÄ Interviewer Takeaway**
üî• **If the dataset is small**, use **Cosine Similarity or KNN**.  
üî• **If the dataset is structured**, use **Na√Øve Bayes or SVM**.  
üî• **If deep learning is required**, use **BERT-based models**.  

These questions cover core Machine Learning concepts, particularly Decision Trees, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and classification techniques. Here's a structured breakdown of the answers:

---

### **Q1: What is a Decision Tree? How to split? How does a Decision Tree work?**  
- **Decision Tree** is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It splits the dataset into branches based on feature values.  
- **Splitting**: A node is split using metrics like  
  - **Gini Impurity** (default in scikit-learn)  
  - **Entropy (Information Gain)**  
  - **Chi-square** (for categorical data)  
  - **Reduction in Variance** (for regression)  
- **How it works?**  
  1. Choose the best feature to split using Gini/Entropy.  
  2. Recursively split the dataset until stopping conditions (like max depth, min samples, etc.) are met.  
  3. The leaf nodes represent the final class or predicted value.

---

### **Q2: What does each node contain in a Decision Tree?**  
Each node consists of:  
- **Feature** used for the split.  
- **Threshold** value for numerical splits.  
- **Gini impurity or entropy** to measure homogeneity.  
- **Number of samples** at that node.  
- **Distribution of target classes** (for classification).  
- **Predicted output** (majority class for classification or mean value for regression).

- Let me simplify it even further! Let‚Äôs break it down in a **storytelling approach** so you can fully grasp what happens inside a Decision Tree.  

---

## **Imagine You Are a Loan Officer at a Bank**
Your job is to **decide whether to approve or reject a loan application**. You have a lot of past data about customers, including their **income** and **credit score**.

You decide to **build a decision tree** that will help you automatically approve or reject loans based on past decisions.

---

## **Step 1: Understanding the Structure of a Decision Tree**
A **Decision Tree** is just like a **flowchart** that asks simple YES/NO questions **step by step** to make a decision.  

For example, when you go out:
- If it‚Äôs **raining**, take an **umbrella**.
- If it‚Äôs **not raining**, wear **sunglasses**.

The **Decision Tree** follows this kind of logic.

---

## **Step 2: What Happens Inside Each Node?**
### **A Decision Tree is made up of 3 types of nodes:**
1. **Root Node üå≥** (First Question)  
   - This is the first and most important question in the tree.  
   - It is chosen based on which question gives the **best split**.  

2. **Decision Nodes üîÄ** (Intermediate Questions)  
   - These nodes ask additional questions to refine the decision.  
   - They split the data further.

3. **Leaf Nodes üçÇ** (Final Answer)  
   - These contain the final decision (e.g., **Loan Approved / Loan Rejected**).  
   - No further questions are asked after this.

---

## **Step 3: Building a Loan Approval Decision Tree**
Let‚Äôs say you have the following **past loan data**:

| Person | Income ($K) | Credit Score | Loan Approved? |
|--------|------------|--------------|---------------|
| A      | 80        | 750          | ‚úÖ Yes        |
| B      | 50        | 600          | ‚ùå No        |
| C      | 90        | 700          | ‚úÖ Yes        |
| D      | 30        | 500          | ‚ùå No        |
| E      | 70        | 650          | ‚úÖ Yes        |

### **Step 3.1: Find the Best First Question (Root Node üå≥)**
The **Decision Tree** will look at all possible features (`Income`, `Credit Score`) and find the best **first question**.

Here, **Income** is the best feature to start with.  

üí° **Question:** "Is Income > 60K?"  
- If **Yes** ‚Üí Move **Right**  
- If **No** ‚Üí Move **Left**  

### **Step 3.2: Next Question (Decision Nodes üîÄ)**
Now, we look at the remaining data after splitting:

1. **Right Side (Income > 60K):**
   - Now, we check **Credit Score**.
   - **New Question:** "Is Credit Score > 650?"

2. **Left Side (Income ‚â§ 60K):**
   - All remaining customers were **already rejected**, so we stop here.

### **Step 3.3: Final Decisions (Leaf Nodes üçÇ)**
- If a person **has high income and a high credit score**, they get **Approved**.
- If a person **has low income or a low credit score**, they get **Rejected**.

---

## **Step 4: Final Decision Tree**
Here‚Äôs how the **Decision Tree** looks:

```
                 [Income > 60K?]  <-- Root Node
                  /        \
         No (Left)        Yes (Right)
        [Reject]       [Credit Score > 650?]
                         /       \
                   Yes (Approve)  No (Reject)
```

### **Example Predictions**
#### **Scenario 1: A New Person Applies for a Loan**
| Income | Credit Score | Decision Process | Final Decision |
|--------|--------------|------------------|---------------|
| 75K    | 720          | **Yes ‚Üí Yes**    | ‚úÖ Approved  |
| 40K    | 580          | **No**           | ‚ùå Rejected  |
| 85K    | 640          | **Yes ‚Üí No**     | ‚ùå Rejected  |

---

## **Step 5: What is Inside Each Node?**
Each node **stores important details** about the split:

| Node Type | What‚Äôs Inside? |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Root Node** üå≥ | The **best feature** to split on (`Income`) and the **threshold value** (60K). |
| **Decision Nodes** üîÄ | The next best feature to split (`Credit Score > 650?`). |
| **Leaf Nodes** üçÇ | The final **class label** (`Approve` or `Reject`). |

---

## **Step 6: Summary**
- The **Decision Tree** asks **YES/NO** questions at each node.
- The **Root Node** is the first and most important split.
- Each **Decision Node** refines the classification further.
- **Leaf Nodes** give the final decision.
- A new person follows the tree path until they reach a **final decision**.

---

### **Q3: What is Entropy and Gini Index? How does it help?**  
- **Entropy**: Measures the randomness in data. Lower entropy means purer splits.  
  \[
  H(X) = -\sum p_i \log_2 p_i
  \]  
  Higher entropy means more disorder, requiring better splits.  
- **Gini Index**: Measures impurity of a node.  
  \[
  G = 1 - \sum p_i^2
  \]  
  - If Gini = 0, all instances belong to a single class (pure node).  
  - Lower Gini means better splits.  
**Use case**:  
- Entropy is slower but gives fine-grained splits.  
- Gini is computationally faster and works well in most cases.
- Let‚Äôs break it down with a **super simple story** and an **example**, so you can **visualize** what **Entropy and Gini Index** mean and how they help in **Decision Trees**.  

---

# **1. What is Entropy? (Chaos Measurement)**
## **Imagine a Classroom üéì**
You are a teacher in a classroom with **20 students**.  
You want to divide them into two groups:  
1. **Boys**  
2. **Girls**  

Now, let‚Äôs consider two cases:  

### **Case 1: Perfectly Organized Class (Low Entropy)**
- The left side has **10 Boys**.  
- The right side has **10 Girls**.  
- Each group is **pure** (only one category).  
- This means **Low Entropy (almost 0)** ‚Üí **Less Chaos.**  

### **Case 2: Completely Mixed Class (High Entropy)**
- Both left and right groups have **5 Boys and 5 Girls**.  
- This is a **highly disorganized** situation.  
- This means **High Entropy (~1)** ‚Üí **More Chaos.**  

### **Mathematical Formula for Entropy**
\[
Entropy = - \sum (p_i \log_2 p_i)
\]
where **p_i** is the probability of each class.

For a **pure group** (only Boys or only Girls):  
- **Entropy = 0** (No confusion)

For a **completely mixed group** (50% Boys, 50% Girls):  
- **Entropy = 1** (Maximum confusion)

---

# **2. What is Gini Index? (Impurity Measurement)**
Gini Index measures how **impure** the data is.  

### **Formula:**
\[
Gini = 1 - \sum (p_i^2)
\]
where **p_i** is the probability of each class.

#### **Example 1: Pure Group (Only Boys or Only Girls)**
- If **all 10 students** are Boys, then  
  \[
  Gini = 1 - (1^2 + 0^2) = 0
  \]
  ‚Üí **Perfectly pure, Gini = 0**  

#### **Example 2: Mixed Group (50% Boys, 50% Girls)**
- If we have **5 Boys and 5 Girls**, then  
  \[
  Gini = 1 - (0.5^2 + 0.5^2) = 0.5
  \]
  ‚Üí **Some impurity, Gini = 0.5**  

#### **Example 3: Very Mixed Group (40% Boys, 60% Girls)**
- If we have **4 Boys and 6 Girls**, then  
  \[
  Gini = 1 - (0.4^2 + 0.6^2) = 0.48
  \]
  ‚Üí **Still impure, but less than 0.5**  

---

# **3. How Do They Help in Decision Trees?**
When building a Decision Tree, we need to decide **which feature** (e.g., `Income`, `Credit Score`) to **split on**.

### **Step 1: Calculate Entropy or Gini Index**
For each possible split, we calculate:
- **Entropy** (Chaos)
- **Gini Index** (Impurity)

### **Step 2: Choose the Best Split**
- The **split that reduces Entropy/Gini the most** is the **best split**.
- This makes our tree **more organized** and decisions **more accurate**.

---

# **4. Example: Loan Approval Decision Tree**
Let‚Äôs say we are deciding whether to approve a **loan** based on **Income**.

| Person | Income ($K) | Loan Approved? |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| A      | 80        | ‚úÖ Yes        |
| B      | 50        | ‚ùå No        |
| C      | 90        | ‚úÖ Yes        |
| D      | 30        | ‚ùå No        |
| E      | 70        | ‚úÖ Yes        |

### **Step 1: Try Splitting by Income at $60K**
#### **Left Side (Income ‚â§ 60K)**
| Person | Loan Approved? |
|--------|---------------|
| B      | ‚ùå No        |
| D      | ‚ùå No        |

- **Both are "No" ‚Üí Pure group**
- **Entropy = 0**, **Gini = 0**

#### **Right Side (Income > 60K)**
| Person | Loan Approved? |
|--------|---------------|
| A      | ‚úÖ Yes        |
| C      | ‚úÖ Yes        |
| E      | ‚úÖ Yes        |

- **All are "Yes" ‚Üí Pure group**
- **Entropy = 0**, **Gini = 0**

**Since both groups are pure, this is the best split! üéØ**

---

# **5. Which One is Better? Entropy vs Gini**
- **Entropy is more complex (log function), but more precise.**
- **Gini is simpler (no logarithm), but sometimes gives the same result.**
- **Most decision tree algorithms (like CART) use Gini by default** because it‚Äôs faster.

---

# **6. Final Summary**
| Metric | Meaning | Formula | Best Value |
|--------|--------|---------|------------|
| **Entropy** | Measures **chaos** | \(-\sum (p_i \log_2 p_i)\) | **0 (pure)** |
| **Gini Index** | Measures **impurity** | \(1 - \sum (p_i^2)\) | **0 (pure)** |

### **Key Takeaways:**
‚úÖ **Low Entropy & Low Gini ‚Üí Good split**  
‚úÖ **High Entropy & High Gini ‚Üí Bad split**  
‚úÖ **Decision Trees use them to decide where to split**

### **Q4: What is Random Forest? What is ‚ÄúRandom‚Äù in Random Forest? How to calculate OOB Error?**  
- **Random Forest** is an ensemble of multiple decision trees. It combines weak learners to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.  
- **Randomness** comes from:  
  - **Bootstrap Sampling** (each tree gets a random subset of data).  
  - **Feature Selection** (each split considers only a random subset of features).  
- **Out-of-Bag (OOB) Error**:  
  - Each tree is trained on a bootstrap sample (about 63% of data).  
  - Remaining 37% (out-of-bag samples) are used to test the tree‚Äôs performance.  
  - OOB Error is the average error across all trees on their respective OOB samples.  
  - Helps estimate generalization error without needing a validation set.

---

### **Q5: How does Random Forest work?**  
1. **Bootstrap Sampling**: Multiple samples are drawn with replacement.  
2. **Feature Selection**: Each tree selects random subsets of features.  
3. **Tree Building**: Each tree is trained on its subset using the Decision Tree algorithm.  
4. **Aggregation**:  
   - For classification ‚Üí majority voting.  
   - For regression ‚Üí average prediction.  
5. **Final Prediction**: Combines results from all trees to improve accuracy.

---

### **Q6: Explain the entire process from data collection to final prediction.**  
1. **Data Collection**: Gather structured/unstructured data from sources.  
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, scaling, encoding categorical features.  
3. **Feature Selection & Engineering**: Identify relevant features, create new features if needed.  
4. **Train-Test Split**: Divide data into training and test sets (e.g., 80-20 split).  
5. **Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate algorithm (Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, etc.).  
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize parameters using Grid Search, Random Search, or Bayesian Optimization.  
7. **Model Training**: Fit the selected model to the training data.  
8. **Model Evaluation**: Use metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, RMSE, etc.  
9. **Deployment**: Deploy the model using Flask, FastAPI, or cloud-based services.  
10. **Monitoring & Maintenance**: Continuously track model performance and retrain if necessary.

---

### **Q7: How does KNN work? Which distance metric to use for categorical data?**  
- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** is a lazy learning algorithm where a new instance is classified based on the majority class of its `k` nearest neighbors.  
- **Distance Metrics for Categorical Data**:  
  - **Hamming Distance** (for binary/categorical data)  
  - **Jaccard Similarity** (for text data)  
  - **Chi-square distance** (for ordinal categorical features)  

---

### **Q8: You have 10 documents. Each topic has been tagged. When a new document arrives, how to tag it?**  
- **Approach**: Text Classification using NLP  
  1. **Convert text to numerical representation**  
     - TF-IDF
