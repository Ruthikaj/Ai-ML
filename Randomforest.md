1Ô∏è‚É£ **What is Random Forest?**  
‚úÖ It is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **How does Random Forest work?**  
‚úÖ It builds multiple decision trees using random subsets of data and features, then averages the results for classification or regression.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Why is Random Forest better than a single Decision Tree?**  
‚úÖ It reduces overfitting, improves accuracy, and handles missing values better.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **What type of algorithm is Random Forest?**  
‚úÖ It is a **supervised learning algorithm** used for both classification and regression tasks.  

5Ô∏è‚É£ **What are the key hyperparameters of Random Forest?**  
‚úÖ Important hyperparameters include `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, and `max_features`.  

6Ô∏è‚É£ **How does Random Forest handle missing values?**  
‚úÖ It uses **proximity-based imputation**, where missing values are predicted based on similar samples.  

7Ô∏è‚É£ **What is bootstrapping in Random Forest?**  
‚úÖ It is a resampling method where each tree is trained on a different random subset of data with replacement.  

8Ô∏è‚É£ **How does Random Forest handle imbalanced data?**

9Ô∏è‚É£ **What is Out-of-Bag (OOB) error in Random Forest?**  
‚úÖ It is an error estimate calculated using data not included in the bootstrap sample, acting like a built-in cross-validation.  

10Ô∏è‚É£ **Can Random Forest handle categorical variables?**

### **üîπ Advanced Random Forest Questions**  

11Ô∏è‚É£ **How does Random Forest handle high-dimensional data?**  
‚úÖ It selects a random subset of features for each tree, preventing overfitting and reducing computation time.

‚úÖ It controls the number of features considered at each split, balancing variance and bias.  

13Ô∏è‚É£ **Why does increasing the number of trees (`n_estimators`) improve performance?**  
‚úÖ More trees reduce variance and improve stability but may increase computation time.  

14Ô∏è‚É£ **How do you tune hyperparameters in Random Forest?**  
‚úÖ Use **Grid Search** or **Randomized Search** to optimize parameters like `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, and `min_samples_split`.  

15Ô∏è‚É£ **What is feature importance in Random Forest?**  
‚úÖ It ranks features based on how much they improve decision-making across all trees.  

16Ô∏è‚É£ **What is the main disadvantage of Random Forest?**  
‚úÖ It requires high computational power and memory, especially with a large number of trees.  

17Ô∏è‚É£ **Can Random Forest be used for real-time predictions?**  
‚úÖ Not ideal for real-time use due to slow prediction speed with many trees, but optimization techniques can improve performance.  

18Ô∏è‚É£ **How does Random Forest compare to Gradient Boosting?**  
‚úÖ **Random Forest** reduces variance but is less accurate than **Gradient Boosting**, which optimizes errors iteratively.  

19Ô∏è‚É£ **What is the difference between Bagging and Boosting?**  
‚úÖ **Bagging** (used in Random Forest) reduces variance, while **Boosting** corrects errors iteratively to reduce bias.  

20Ô∏è‚É£ **Can Random Forest be used for time-series forecasting?**  
‚úÖ It can be applied but lacks time-awareness; techniques like feature engineering with lag variables are needed.
