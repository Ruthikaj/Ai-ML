   â†’ `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, and `max_features`.  

5. **How does Random Forest prevent overfitting?**  
   â†’ By averaging multiple treesâ€™ predictions, reducing model variance.  

6. **What is the role of bootstrap sampling in Random Forest?**  
   â†’ It allows each tree to train on different data samples, improving diversity.

   â†’ When computational efficiency is a concern or for very high-dimensional sparse data.  

12. **What is Out-of-Bag (OOB) error in Random Forest?**  
   â†’ The validation error measured using data not included in the bootstrap sample.  

13. **Does Random Forest work well with imbalanced data?**  
   â†’ It can struggle, but techniques like class weighting or SMOTE can help.  

14. **How does Random Forest handle categorical data?**  
   â†’ It requires categorical features to be one-hot encoded or label-encoded.  

15. **What is the impact of increasing the number of trees (`n_estimators`)?**  
   â†’ It improves stability but increases training time.  

16. **How does Random Forest perform feature selection?**  
   â†’ By ranking feature importance based on impurity reduction.  

17. **What is the difference between Bagging and Random Forest?**  
   â†’ Random Forest adds feature randomness to Bagging, improving variance reduction.  

18. **Can Random Forest handle multi-class classification?**  
   â†’ Yes, it supports both binary and multi-class classification problems.  

19. **How does increasing `max_depth` affect Random Forest?**  
   â†’ It can increase accuracy but may lead to overfitting.  

20. **Why is Random Forest robust to noise?**  
   â†’ Because averaging multiple trees reduces the effect of noisy data.  

21. **What is the impact of `max_features` on model performance?**  
   â†’ Lower values increase diversity, while higher values make trees more similar.  

22. **Does Random Forest require feature scaling?**  
   â†’ No, it is not sensitive to feature scaling.  

23. **How does Random Forest handle large datasets?**  
   â†’ It parallelizes tree training but can be slow for very large datasets.  

24. **Can Random Forest be used for time series forecasting?**  
   â†’ Not directly, but it can be used for lag-based feature engineering.  

25. **How does Random Forest perform compared to SVM?**  
   â†’ It works better for larger datasets, while SVM is more effective for small, high-dimensional data.  

26. **What type of problems is Random Forest best suited for?**  
   â†’ Classification and regression tasks with structured tabular data.  

27. **Does increasing `n_estimators` always improve accuracy?**  
   â†’ Only up to a certain point, after which it has diminishing returns.  

28. **What are the drawbacks of Random Forest?**  
   â†’ High memory usage, slow inference, and less interpretability.  

29. **How does Random Forest compare to XGBoost?**  
   â†’ XGBoost generally outperforms Random Forest in structured data with boosting.  

30. **Why does Random Forest not work well with sparse data?**  
   â†’ Decision trees struggle with high-dimensional sparse feature spaces.  

31. **How does Random Forest deal with correlated features?**  
   â†’ It randomly selects features for each tree, reducing bias.  

32. **Is Random Forest affected by outliers?**  
   â†’ Less affected than linear models but still sensitive compared to robust methods.  

33. **Can Random Forest be used for anomaly detection?**  
   â†’ Yes, using unsupervised variations like Isolation Forest.  

34. **What is a Random Forest Regressor?**  
   â†’ A version of Random Forest used for regression problems.  

35. **Does Random Forest support online learning?**  
   â†’ No, it requires retraining from scratch when new data arrives.  

36. **Why do deeper trees increase variance?**  
   â†’ They fit the training data too closely, reducing generalization.  

37. **How does Random Forest handle highly imbalanced datasets?**  
   â†’ Using class weighting, oversampling, or undersampling techniques.  

38. **Can Random Forest perform well on high-dimensional data?**  
   â†’ It can struggle due to the curse of dimensionality but is better than individual trees.  

39. **How do you interpret the output of a Random Forest model?**  
   â†’ By analyzing feature importance and individual tree predictions.  

40. **Why is bagging used in Random Forest?**  
   â†’ To reduce variance by training on different subsets of data.  

41. **What happens if all trees in Random Forest are identical?**  
   â†’ The model loses its advantage, becoming equivalent to a single tree.  

42. **Why is Random Forest called an ensemble method?**  
   â†’ Because it combines multiple models (trees) to improve predictions.  

43. **Can Random Forest be used for feature engineering?**  
   â†’ Yes, by selecting important features for model training.  

44. **What is the impact of pruning in Random Forest?**  
   â†’ Pruning is not commonly used since Random Forest relies on averaging many trees.  

45. **What happens if `min_samples_split` is too high?**  
   â†’ Trees become shallow, reducing model complexity and accuracy.  

46. **How does Random Forest compare to a neural network?**  
   â†’ Neural networks perform better for unstructured data, while Random Forest is better for tabular data.  

47. **How does Random Forest handle duplicate data points?**  
   â†’ It can still generalize well but may give biased results if duplicates dominate.  

48. **Can Random Forest be used in reinforcement learning?**  
   â†’ Not directly, but it can assist in policy evaluation tasks.  

49. **What is the role of entropy in Random Forest?**
