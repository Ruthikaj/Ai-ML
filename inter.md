### **Clustering vs. Classification**

- **Clustering**  
  - **Type:** Unsupervised Learning  
  - **Purpose:** Group data points based on similarity without using labeled data.  
  - **Example:**  
    - **K-Means Clustering:** Grouping customers into segments based on purchasing behavior.  
    - **Hierarchical Clustering:** Creating a dendrogram of similar documents or images.

- **Classification**  
  - **Type:** Supervised Learning  
  - **Purpose:** Assign a predefined label (or class) to new data points using a model trained on labeled data.  
  - **Example:**  
    - **Spam Detection:** Classifying emails as "spam" or "not spam."
    - **Medical Diagnosis:** Classifying images as "diseased" or "healthy."

### **Common Classification Algorithms**

1. **Logistic Regression:**  
   - Predicts binary outcomes by modeling the probability using the logistic (sigmoid) function.
   
2. **Decision Trees:**  
   - Uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences.
   
3. **Random Forests:**  
   - An ensemble of decision trees that reduces overfitting by averaging multiple trees' predictions.
   
4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM):**  
   - Finds the best hyperplane to separate data into classes.
   
5. **Naïve Bayes:**  
   - A probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes’ theorem with strong (naïve) independence assumptions.
   
6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**  
   - Classifies a new instance based on the majority class among its k-nearest neighbors.
   
7. **Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost):**  
   - Builds a strong classifier by combining many weak models (typically decision trees) in an iterative fashion.
   
8. **Neural Networks:**  
   - Models complex patterns using layers of interconnected neurons, effective in both classification and regression tasks.

### **Difference Between Classification and Regression**

- **Classification:**  
  - **Output:** Discrete labels (e.g., spam vs. not spam, disease vs. no disease).  
  - **Goal:** Predict the category or class of an input.  
  - **Example:** Classifying customer reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.

- **Regression:**  
  - **Output:** Continuous numerical values (e.g., price, temperature).  
  - **Goal:** Predict a quantity.  
  - **Example:** Predicting the selling price of a house based on its features.
